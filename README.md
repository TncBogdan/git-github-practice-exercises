# git-github-practice-exercises

These are challenges for practicing the concepts we talked about in our training (<a href="https://frontend.ro/evenimente/git-incepatori" rel="nofollow">Git & GitHub training</a>)

## Challenges

To have the best results, don't hurry and carefully read each challenge. Make sure you **solve them in order**:

### Learning challenges

1. **Fork** this repo
2. `clone` the repo on your PC
3. Add a new cell into the **grid** from *prep.html* and write your name or nickname in there.
4. Add a new commit following the convention: `[username] - description`.
5. Push those changes on *master*
6. Add a photo of youself inside the `assets/participants` folder. Let's name it after your `username`.
7. Add that photo to the cell from  **step 3**.
8. Add **one commit** for each modified file. Let's keep the same convention as last time: `[username] - description`.
9. Push both commits on *master*.
10. Create a new branch from *master* named **prep-challenges**

--- From now on work on this new branch

11. Add in *prep.html* a new cell with a description of yourself. 
12. `commit` and `push` this new cell.
13. Add one of the trainers as a contributor in your project
14. The trainer will add in *prep.html* a new cell with a photo of himself/herself.
15. Trainer pushes on **master** directly.
16. Create a PR (Pull Request) to add your code in **master**.
17. Fix the *merge conflicts*
18. Merge branch. Now on master will be both descriptions!
19. Hooray! You've finished the learning challenges. You can move on to the next which you'll implement on your own.

1. Move to the *master* branch of the repo.
2. Create a new branch called **vscode**.
3. Add a new cell into the **grid** from *exercitii.html* and write your name or nickname in there.
4. Add the "Fill-in info" component in *index.html* and write your name or nickname in there. (you can find it's markup at the bottom of this page)
5. Add **one commit** for each modified file. Let's keep the same convention as last time: `[username] - description`
6. `push` these changes on *master*
7. Create a new branch from the current one (vscode) named **challenges**

--- From now on work on this new branch

8. Add in *exercitii.html* a new cell with a photo of yourself. `commit` and `push` this code.
9. Add another cell with some short info about yourself. It can be a favorite hobby, your job title, or why you want to learn Git?! After you're done, `commit` and `push` this code as well.
10. Let's use the "Commands list" component and add a list of all the actions used so far in the grid.
11. `commit` and `push` the new modifications
12. Add in *exercitii.html* a new cell with the number of commits you've done so far.
13. `commit` and `push` changes in the remote repo
15. We're wondering whether instead of the list of actions we should add a description about Git/GitHub. Let's create a new branch named **challenges-v2** where we're gonna experiement with this.

--- From now on work on this new branch

16. `push` the branch in the remote repo. Now you should have 3 branches total.
17. `revert` the commit with the actions list
18. Add a small description about Git inside a new cell from *exercitii.html*. Then `push` in the remote repo
19. We decide to keep the old version.
20. Make a `PR` to `vscode` from `challenges` branch.
21. After approval, merge it.
22. Navigate to `vscode` branch and `pull` the changes locally.
23. Test that everything looks ok.
24. Done! ðŸ’ª
